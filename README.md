**Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Analysis – SQL & Tableau**

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes loan application data to identify trends in good loans vs. bad loans. The dataset includes key parameters such as loan status, credit grades, home ownership, interest rates, employment details, and loan amounts. The analysis is performed using SQL for data processing and Tableau for data visualization.

**Objectives & Key Insights**
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand patterns in loan defaults and identify risk factors associated with bad loans. The key insights derived from this project include:

      1. Home Ownership Patterns in Bad Loans

          Renters have the highest tendency for loan defaults, compared to homeowners or those with mortgages.

      2.Credit Grade vs. Bad Loan Trend

          Borrowers with lower credit grades (F and G) show the highest bad loan tendencies, indicating a direct correlation between creditworthiness and loan defaults.
      
      3.Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Applications

          The total number of bad loan applications compared to good loan applications shows the percentage of loan defaults in the dataset.
      4.Loan Amount vs. Bad Loan Amount

          Analyzing the total loan amount received vs. the total bad loan amount helps in understanding the financial impact of loan defaults.

**Dataset Details**

The dataset includes the following columns:

ID, Issue Date, Loan Status, Home Ownership, Credit Grade, Interest Rate, Loan Amount, Employment Length, Purpose, Total Payment, and Verification Status.

**Technologies Used**
SQL (MySQL) – Data extraction and processing
Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation

**Visualizations & Dashboard**
The Tableau dashboard includes:
✅ Home ownership patterns for bad loans
✅ Credit grade impact on loan defaults
✅ Good loan vs. bad loan applications comparison
✅ Loan amount vs. bad loan amount
